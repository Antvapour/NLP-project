# NLP-project
An NLP Project for an interview

Note: It was found that id 30944 in the training set contains invalid information. Thus I decided to delete this row.

Evaluation results for both models are in the results folder. Trained model files could be found in the corresponding model folders. Note that BERT model is too big to push onto GitHub, thus a link of google drive is provided instead.

Code for the models are in helpers.py, baseline.py, and sota.py. In order to test the models, another file named resultGeneration.py is used to reproduce the results. It could be used for other test sets as well.

Most of the engineering choices are explained in the comments of the python files. A wrap-up report called report.docx is also provided.
